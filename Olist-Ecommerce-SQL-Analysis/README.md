## 🗃️ **Dataset Used**

Olist E-commerce dataset (public Kaggle dataset).
Main tables used in this project:

* `olist_customers_dataset`
* `olist_orders_dataset`

These tables contain detailed information about:
✔ Customers
✔ Orders
✔ Order status
✔ Customer locations

## 🧠 **SQL Concepts Used**

This project uses several SQL techniques commonly required for Data Analyst roles:

* `GROUP BY` and aggregations
* `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `ROUND`
* `JOIN` (INNER & LEFT JOIN)
* Customer segmentation
* State-wise comparison
* Order distribution analysis

---

## 🔍 **Key Analysis Performed**

### ✔ **1. Customer Analysis**

* Total customers
* Unique customers
* Repeat customers
* Customer distribution across states

👉 Stored in:
`sql/customer_analysis.sql`
`Insights/customer_insights.md`

---

### ✔ **2. Orders Analysis**

* Total orders
* Orders by status (delivered, shipped, cancelled, etc.)
* Order timeline patterns

👉 Stored in:
`sql/orders_analysis.sql`

---

### ✔ **3. State-wise Analysis**

* Customers per state
* Orders per state
* Orders-per-customer ratio
* Identify states with high customers but low orders

👉 Stored in:
`sql/state_wise_analysis.sql`
`Insights/state_insights.md`

## 📈 **Business Insights (Summary)**

### 🧩 Customer Insights

* SP (São Paulo) has the highest number of customers
* Repeat customer rate is low → opportunity for loyalty programs
* Majority of customers come from top 5 states

### 📍 State Insights

* SP leads in both customers and orders
* Some states have high customer count but low order volume → requires targeted marketing
* Orders-per-customer ratio varies significantly across states

These insights help understand:

* Which regions to target
* Customer behaviour across states
* Business opportunities
